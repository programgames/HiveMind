## Physical Setup

### Machine Layout
Place blocks adjacent to the computer according to this configuration:

```
    [Storage]
        |
[Input] - [Computer] - [Mechanical User]
        |
   [Advanced Mutatron]
        |
  [Industrial Apiary]
        |
    [Output]
```

### Side Configuration
Default sides (configurable in code):
- Left: Input chest
- Front: Advanced Mutatron
- Back: Industrial Apiary
- Bottom: Output chest
- Right: Mechanical User (redstone connection)

### Wiring
1. Connect Mechanical User to computer with redstone
2. Position Mechanical User to activate the Industrial Apiary
3. Place beebee gun with Assassin Queen in Mechanical User's inventory slot 1
4. Ensure all machines have adequate power
5. Connect Adapter blocks to Gendustry machines for API access (optional)

## Software Installation

1. Place the main.lua file on the computer's filesystem
2. Ensure the computer has an Inventory Controller upgrade installed
3. Run the program with: `lua main.lua`

## Configuration

Edit the config table in main.lua to match your setup:

```lua
local config = {
    mech_user_side = sides.right,     -- Mechanical User redstone side
    mutatron_side = sides.front,      -- Advanced Mutatron location
    apiary_side = sides.back,         -- Industrial Apiary location
    input_chest_side = sides.left,    -- Input chest location
    output_chest_side = sides.down,   -- Output chest location
    apiary_wait_time = 30,            -- Apiary processing time (seconds)
    beebee_gun_slot = 1,              -- Beebee gun slot in Mechanical User
    enabled_mods = {"Forestry", "MagicBees", "ExtraBees", "Career Bees", "MeatballCraft"}, -- Limit included mods
}
```

Tip: Use enabled_mods to restrict which mods’ species are considered when planning.

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Place starting bee species (Forest, Meadows princesses and drones) in input chest
2. Ensure beebee gun with Assassin Queen is in Mechanical User slot 1
3. Ensure machines are powered and properly configured
4. Run the program

### Operation
1. The program scans all connected inventories for available bees
2. Select target bee species from the menu (supports filtering by mod)
   - Menu commands: `n`/`p` to page, `f` to filter by mod, `s` to search, `c` to clear the filter, `0` to quit
3. Review the generated breeding strategy showing:
   - Golden path (main princess lineage)
   - Base species the plan consumes, princesses and drones counted separately
   - Required drone paths
   - Accumulation cycles needed
4. Confirm execution to start automated breeding

### Breeding Strategy
The program uses a three-phase approach:
1. Breed required drone species first
2. Run accumulation cycles to build drone reserves
3. Execute golden path using accumulated resources

### Base Species You Have to Supply
Species with no mutation in the database are the raw material: the program can
never produce them, it only consumes them. The plan lists them before execution,
for example:

```
=== BASE SPECIES REQUIRED ===
Forest: 1/1 princesses, 0/1 drones  ✗ missing +1D
Meadows: 1/3 princesses, 4/2 drones  ✗ missing +2P
Note: drones can be regrown with accumulation cycles, princesses cannot.
```

The princess/drone split matters. Every breeding step consumes one princess of
the left parent and one drone of the right parent, and an apiary cycle always
yields exactly one princess back — so a princess stock never grows on its own.
Each princess lineage that starts on a base species needs its own princess,
taken from a wild hive or produced by a Gendustry Replicator. Drones are the
renewable half: accumulation cycles regrow them, at the cost of one apiary
cycle each.

### Status Indicators

#### Colored Lamp Status
When a programmable colored lamp is connected, it displays the current system status:

Compatible Mods:
- OpenLights (recommended - has `coloredlamp` component)
- Any mod exposing a `setLampColor()`-like API

Status Colors:
- White - Idle/Ready for commands
- Green - Working normally (breeding, processing)
- Yellow - Waiting for resources (beebee gun, materials)
- Red - Error state (requires user intervention)
- Orange - Manually paused
- Blue - Task completed successfully
- Purple - Operation aborted by user

#### Chat Notifications
When a Notification Interface is connected, the system sends important status updates:
- System startup and breeding sequence start
- Error messages with details
- Major completion notifications
- User action confirmations (resume, abort)

Configure in main.lua:
```lua
config.use_status_lamp = true
config.use_chat_notifications = true
config.chat_player_name = nil -- Broadcast to all (or set specific player)
```

## Testing and Analysis

For developer tests, run the planning and execution test suite and view analysis artifacts. See TESTING.md for commands and details.

### Analysis Artifacts
Tests generate detailed analysis files in the `Artifacts/` folder (auto-created on first test run):

- `BeeSpecies_analysis.txt` — Complete breeding tree analysis
  - Visual breeding tree with dependency hints
  - Required starting princesses and drone counts
  - Missing species identification
  - Optimization recommendations and sanity checks

- `BeeSpecies_execution_*.txt` — Execution testing results
  - Detailed execution logs with GUI interactions
  - Breeding step validation and failure analysis
  - Mock function call traces for debugging
  - Performance metrics and timing information

## Supported Mods

- Forestry (base bees and mutations)
- MagicBees (mystical and thaumic species)
- ExtraBees/Binnie's Mods (industrial, stone, color variants)
- Career Bees (job-themed species)
- MeatballCraft (custom chains and late-game species)
- Gendustry (automation and genetic manipulation)

The bee database is defined in `loadBeeDatabase()` in `main.lua` and can be extended.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- "Inventory Controller upgrade required": Install the upgrade in the computer
- "No inventories found": Check that chests are adjacent to computer
- "Could not find X bee": Ensure required parent species are available in input/output chests
- "Waiting for beebee gun": Gun is missing or being recharged — program will wait automatically
- API failures: Verify Adapter blocks are connected to Gendustry machines

### Machine Problems
- Mutatron not producing queens: Check power, materials, and activation
- Apiary not processing: Verify environment, power, and queen placement
- Items not moving: Confirm inventory controller has access to all sides

### Performance
- Large breeding trees may take some time to complete
- Adjust `apiary_wait_time` based on your apiary's speed
- Consider running accumulation cycles during off-peak times

## Technical Details

### Breeding Algorithm
The system builds a complete parent tree for the target, then applies stock-aware pruning and reuse optimizations to minimize steps while keeping execution feasible.

### Resource Management
Produced queens and drones are tracked and reused. Materials can be sourced from input/output chests and adjacent storage. The program automatically waits for the beebee gun before activating the Mechanical User.

### API Integration
If Gendustry API is available via Adapter blocks, the program uses it for machine control; otherwise it falls back to redstone activation through the Mechanical User.

## Limitations

- Requires manual setup of physical machine layout
- Processing time depends on apiary efficiency and power supply
- Some advanced bee species may require specific environmental conditions
- Cross-mod compatibility depends on installed mods and versions
